1. **Range Query and Point Update**: In case of point updates we dont care about associativity becuase we will update each node (O(log n)) from the root to the leaf. For example if range query is sum and point update is set operation (a[i] <- new_value). The final outcome will depend on which set operation happened last but we are applying update immediately so it doesn't matter if point update is set operation (non associative) or sum operation (associative). Example problem [Range Query: Min & Point Update: Set](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/4/1/practice/contest/273169/problem/B), [Range Query: Sum & Point Update: Set](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/4/1/practice/contest/273169/problem/A)
3. **Range Query and Associative Range Update**: Associative range update means order of update doesn't matter. For example sum operation
